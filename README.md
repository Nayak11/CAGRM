 Student Names: Shraddha Jamadade, Kirati Bhuva, Spandana Padala, Suhas Nayak

1) Project title: Home Security System using Arduino Uno board
Project description: The aim of the project is to build a system which can record a snapshot of
the person entering a house and send it with an intrusion alert text message to our cell phones.
Further we can maintain a log of all the guests/ people entered the house in a web application so
that users can easily retrieve the dates and timings of their arrival and get real time notifications
on our digital devices. This system will be deployed on IBM cloud thus making it hardware free
and a multi-tenant SaaS application.
 Technologies: Synchronizing Arduino Uno with GSM Shield, PIR Sensor, Webcam, DS3231
using Arduino IDE.

2) Project Title : Lucy helps keep our seniors happy and engaged
 Project Description: The aim of this project is to help senior citizens to avoid from being
depressed. There are couples of factors that can lead to depression such as feeling loneliness,
isolation from their children etc which will have serious impact on physical and mental health of
individual. The proposed app “Lucy” helps to share motivation stories, greetings and thoughts
from the student volunteers of NGO which makes them feel togetherness and happy. The
principle behind this app is, student volunteers from NGO writes motivational stories, their
greetings or thoughts to a generic mail account. All senior people will be informed to gather on a
day at specified time well in advance. Lucy picks a mail written by student volunteer and reads
out to the senior citizens.
 Technologies : Dialog flow(api.ai) by Google or Alexa skill kit by Amazon web services, Rest
webservice for reading mail from the mail account, Node JS, Heroku to host the web service

3) Project title: WeServe - Connecting pro-bono and student volunteers to the NGOs around the
world.
 Project description: The aim of this project is to provide NGOs with a digital system to perform
their operations and avoid the use of traditional paper based and manual processing. This will
reduce the time taken for scheduling events, getting volunteers and pro-bono consultants. The
goal is to make their operations much more effective. This system will act as an interface
between these entities. NGO posts the project. Students and pro bono consultants create their
profile, interests and expertise and timeline they might be available to work/help. System applies
intelligent algorithm to match them.
 Technologies: Node JS, JavaScript, MySQL

4) Project Title: Wastage reduction through donation.
 Project Description: Across the world, there are lots of people, restaurants that waste tons of
food, clothes and goods. Our web application will create link between charity homes, NGOs and
people who want to donate those things, so that they can go and collect donation from People.
People can also be rewarded with “goodDeed” points through it which can be use for their own
marketing efforts by being a responsible social person.
 Technologies: React JS, Node JS , AWS, MySQL
